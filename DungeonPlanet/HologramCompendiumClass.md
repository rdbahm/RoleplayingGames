# The Hologram
### A New Compendium Class

If your character is a hologram, choose a method of hologram projection:
- Nano-Swarm: Your projection is produced by a swarm of nanites which each project a small potion of your projection. Losing nanites (through damage or otherwise) reduces the maximum size or density of the projection. Nanites seperated from your "body" are deactivated until recollected. When projection is deactivated, the bonds which hold the nanites together are disabled, reducing your body to a small pile of dust until reactivated. +1HP 
- Light Bee: A small (fist-sized or smaller) hovering projector which produces a projector. The projector is tied to the hovering system, so movement is limited or impossible while not projected. Your Light Bee contains all your sensors - for all intents and purposes, it acts as your eyes. +2HP

Regardless of your choice, your Load is -2 while tangible and -4 while intangible. In addition, while you are able to alter your hair and clothing, your physical appearance is preprogrammed and cannot be changed without the services of a skilled technician. Choose one "tell" which allows a keen-eyed observer to identify you as a hologram - an emblem, a characteristic flicker, or slight translucency.

You gain these moves:
#### Magic Smoke
When you lose all your hit points, you don't roll for your Last Breath: the one who rebuilds or repairs you does, and deals with Death on your behalf. If they are a scientist or technician, they can roll+INT.

#### Change Projection Modes
On your command, your projection system can switch between "tangible" and "intangible" modes. This process can take a few moments of concentration. When in danger or when trying to switch quickly, roll+CON to overdrive the switch between modes, avoiding a delay. On a 10+, the switch happens instantly with no ill effects. On a 7+, the switch is able to be completed, but due to a malfunction, the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

#### Deactivate Projector
Your projection can be deactivated and reactivated at will. Use the same rules for "Change Projection Modes" when in danger.

#### Circuit Damage
When your hit points are reduced to below 4 HP, your projection system is damaged. Roll+CON to keep the projection online. On 10+, your systems contain the damage and continue functioning. On a 7+, projection systems malfunction - the GM will tell you how. On a 6-, your projector is deactivated.

If you are a hologram, these count as class moves for you and you can choose from them when you level up:
#### Divide Nanites (Nano-Swarm Projection)
If a large number of nanites have been divided from your primary form, you can transfer part of your consciousness to that set of nanites. This allows you to be in two places. Both bodies will be substantially smaller than normal, and due to the additional load on each nanite, take -1 ongoing while in this form.

#### Photon Overload (Light Bee Projection)
Overload the projector's photon emitters, blinding nearby enemies. Roll+STR. On a 10+, choose 3. On a 7+, choose 1.
- Deal 1d4+2 damage to enemies (close).
- Temporarily blind nearby enemies (reach).
- Do not take 1d4 self-damage.
- Do not deactivate your projection systems after the overload.

#### Durable Projector
When you perform the "Last Breath" action, take +1 forward. Your projector additionally gains additional armor when exposed (+1 armor when projection is deactivated)

#### Failsafe Systems
When "Circuit Damage" occurs while in "tangible" mode, if you choose to deactivate your projector, the tangibility circuits disappate any damage above the amount which triggered "Circuit Damage." For instance, if Circuit Damage occurs at 3 HP, your health will remain at 3 HP if you voluntarily turn your projector off.

#### Decoupled Kinetic Generator
When intentionally disabling projection, you may choose to retain the ability to interact and move, rendering yourself hard to see. However, your projection source is still visible.
